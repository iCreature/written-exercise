Good morning Joe

I hope this email finds you well. My team and I are excited to working on the mobile fin-tech product and your team at large. But before we can start brain storming on a solution they are few thing I was hoping we could discuss and iron-out so we can get the full scope of the project and what is required from the solution.

1. Do we need/require real-time endpoint or a nighlty batch upload or periodical batch upload like every 4 hours or so?
    - it does bare mention that a real-time endpoint would most likely mean more work from both my team and your team to ensure uptime.
2. In terms of data, is it in a single schema for all transactions or does it need mulitple schemas?
3. How much infrastructure do we need to provision for ? Our goal is to make sure that we don't over provision which will lead to our budget being higher than it already is, and under provisioning also lead us to under budget and cost us more going forward, when the project/product goes live.

Our aim is to make sure that we are able to provide a product with adequate support and also being mindful and wherry of the budget constrains. If you have any question or concerns please don't hesitate to reach out and I will get back at you as soon as possible  

Kind Regards,
Mxolisi Msweli
